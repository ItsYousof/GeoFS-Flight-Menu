# GeoFS-Flight-Menu

Hello everyone, I have been working on an addon for GeoFS a flight simulator: https://www.geo-fs.com
I always felt like GeoFS was messing a lot of things in the game, today I decided that I wanted to change that. Over the course of ONE week I managed to program something that would make GeoFS more relistic, more ALIVE. I represent to you a Flight menu for GeoFS airplanes
AVALIABE TO ALL AIRCRAFTS!
This addon has PA Actions, meaning that you can talk to the passengers and inform them about what state of the flight you are on

Down sides from using the flight planning system is that you would have to insert your OWN waypoints if you would like a chart of all the waypoints here is a link: https://flightplandatabase.com/plan/7775441 Make sure to zoom into the map to see ALL the waypoints avaliabe.
